        <p>Yes. It is possible to time travel into the future.</p>
        <p>
            Imagine a world where clocks tick slower, years pass in moments, and traveling at near-light speeds could catapult you far into the future. It sounds like science fiction, yet it’s rooted in one of the most profound scientific discoveries of the 20th century: Einstein’s theory of relativity.

            Time travel into the future is not just a product of imaginative storytelling—it’s a scientifically plausible phenomenon. But how can we skip ahead in time? To answer this, we must unravel the mysteries of special relativity, which explores the physics of objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity, which reveals the influence of gravity on the fabric of space and time itself.

        <p>
            These two revolutionary theories challenge our intuitive understanding of time. They tell us that time is not absolute but a malleable dimension influenced by speed and gravity. Through this website, we’ll explore how these principles make futuristic time travel a real possibility and delve into some fascinating thought experiments and visual simulations that bring us closer to understanding the nature of time.

            Let’s explore how we can time-travel into the future with theory of relativity.
